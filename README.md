##üß† What I Learned
Working on the RystBrewery Brewing & CIP Automation System has significantly enhanced my understanding of building simulation based control systems and full-stack desktop applications. This project combined real-time logic, UI responsiveness, and backend integration using modern .NET technologies. Here are the key takeaways:

### C# WPF & MVVM Architecture
- I gained valuable experience building a responsive desktop application using WPF and the MVVM design pattern. This helped me understand how to separate concerns between UI, logic, and data, while maintaining scalability and testability.

### Real-Time Simulation and State Handling
- Implementing step-by-step brewing and CIP simulations taught me how to model dynamic processes, manage time-based events, and update UI elements in real time ‚Äî critical skills for industrial or process-control software.

### Safety Systems & Alarm Handling
- Designing and enforcing safety rules (e.g., auto-stop on temperature thresholds) gave me practical insight into implementing fault-tolerant, user-safe systems, including visual status indicators and emergency logic.

### Data Logging & Storage with SQLite
- Using SQLite for persistent storage of logs and recipes improved my understanding of embedded databases, data filtering, and local data querying within desktop applications.

### Structured Logging with Serilog
- I learned to implement structured and file-based logging for traceability, debugging, and system transparency, especially important in production or audit-heavy environments.

### User Authentication & Access Control
- Integrating login functionality into a local app taught me how to restrict system access, track user sessions, and securely manage interactions ‚Äî even outside of a web environment.

### Data Visualization with LiveCharts2
- Leveraging LiveCharts2 enabled me to render live-updating charts and temperature curves, enhancing both user experience and operational insight.

### Configuration Management
- Working with JSON and XML files for recipes and settings deepened my understanding of configuration-driven application design, enabling easier extensibility and customization.

### Clean Architecture Principles
- I applied service abstraction, dependency injection, and layered separation (Models, Services, UI), resulting in a maintainable and modular codebase that can evolve or scale over time.
